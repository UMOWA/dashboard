Download USGS discharge data (ts of 15-minute observations) from Holter and Cascade, and Temperature from Holter. Get into seperate columns in a .csv and make own column names. (Can totally erase all header info) Then use script USGStoFullTS.R to estimate monthly means and write correct columns into the Website/Data folder you're working in. 
e.g. see Website_v3devUpdate for the FullTS. csv I just wrote out during the 2023 update.
